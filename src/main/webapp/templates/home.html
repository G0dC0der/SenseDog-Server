    <p>Have you ever wanted to share a link and see how many times it have been clicked? Then you have come to the right place!</p>
    <p>Clickcount is a public web service allowing anyone to wrap an arbitrary URL around one generated from our servers.<br>

        The generated URL will immediately forward the request to the source URL while secretly increasing the counter.</p>
    <p>Clickcount can also minify URLs, making them more appealing to look at. Head to the <span ng-click="jumpTo(1);"  class="add-tab-link">add</span> page to get started!</p>
